# Feather Boards and Wings in Fusion 360

This is the collection of fusion 360 models for Adafruit feather boards, wings, and header pins. They are modified versions of files that I found here

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CAD_Parts

I modified them to add pin holes circular sketches on some of the solder pads so that you can connect the pins and holes using modeled wires.
